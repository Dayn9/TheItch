Doctors Note 1: GARDEN

No signs of the blood lily anywhere, but we have discovered that those affected by the virus can make vines grow. 
They seem to exhaust themselves in the process.

Doctors Note 2: BASOPHIL

It's good to be back home again. The gemstones from the founders statues are still missing
I should look for them when all this is over

Doctors Note 3: WILDS

Some of my companions affected by the virus have started learning how to absorb energy from the vine. 
I'm starting to have concerns about their powers.

Doctors Note 4: SHRINE

Our camp was almost overrun by a landslide last night. One of the farmers heard distant footsteps just before it began. 
Someone doesn't want us here

Doctors Note 5: SANCTUARY

I got into an argument with Erin about the different flowers in this cavern
She may have called it a healing lily but that's not at all what it does. 

Doctors Note 6: GRAVEYARD

Tony was the first to volunteer for this trip, I wonder if he knew how badly the virus affected him
The remaining five us will search on in his memory 

Doctors Note 7: ISLAND

The last of my companions fell to their death today while attempting to reach the blood lily. 
Without their powers I'm unable to make it up there myself
